## OLD BUT USEFUL CODE

#using the summary function again, we display all the data in the shapefile
#now we see our new column \"datetime\"
#however, this is a character again
#we will need to convert this into something meaningful to analyze

#summary(T_data)

# I need to extract the hours and minutes from the $datetime column
#I found the code below which I think will help to get to the point where I will have the time value needed
#However, I am unsure how to match up what I see in the code below to our data

#I ran the code and it produces results but again, my confusion lies in how to translate the example code into something that works with #our data

#Time <- factor(\"08:01:01\")

# parese date
#a <- hms(as.character(Time))

# get hours
#hour(a)

# get minutes
#minute(a)

# so overall - nice work
#a <- hms(T_data$time)
#T_data$hour <- hour(a)
#T_data$minutes <- minute(a)
